            ambition of its respected, ethical and energetic young president. As all profits go back into the Company, dividends are not expected to be declared in the

            of public fancy. Stock in this company represents a somewhat speculative investment with a good growth pattern. Because it is popular with the investing public, 
            it has a fairly high price-to-earnings ratio and low yield.</td>
